# Game-Engines-Assignment
Connor Ryan - C16755215. This repository will be updated with my work for the Game Engines assignment. 

## Intro

For my project I wanted to create something beautiful that reacts to sound and music. The first thing that came to mind was an audio visualiser. However this is something that is done alot and I would like to create something a bit more unique.
After browsing through the list of suggested I rested on the idea of a procedral forest with the foliage reacting to the music being played in the background. I aim to create this with a more spacey, non earthly feel using bright neon style colours.

## Aim 

My aim is to create a procedurally generated forest, full of different types of trees with different colours. The foilage on these trees will react to music in different ways. As of yet I have not decided exactly on what will do this but perhaps the leaves on the trees will grow and shrink based on bass detection or the branches will wobble whilst reacting. Ideally I will implement a FPS controller so that the user may explore the scene.

## Challenge

I think I will be posed by many difficulties when undertaking this task. I have never procedurally generated terrain or objects before. On top of this I expect making these prodecurally generated objects interact with music will pose its own problem as well. In the event this happens, perhaps I may have to re-evaluate my approach. Although saying this there are many tutorials and explanations I can use to help me achieve my goal. I have played around with audio visualisers so I am confident in creating something on that front.
